								<h3>Photography</h3>
								<p>
									Professionally, I've done portraits, sports team photography, martial arts photography, school dances and graduations.<br />
									But I don't seek out those kinds of gigs much anymore. I focus these days on personal photography - birds, flora and fauna, some landscapes.
									My photos capture my personal experience outdoors. I print and hang some of the photos in our home, and use the photos as source material for other projects.

								<h3>Glass Work</h3>
								<p>
									Years ago, I started playing with fused glass. I've always loved the medium, but never stuck with it because it takes up space, burns energy, and most of the time is spent watching kilns fire isntead of doing active work.
									But I am trying again - some newer kilns can work faster, and I have one on order. Once it arrives, I have a process in mind to try to use my photos as a reference source to create glass paintings.<br />
									This project is just getting rolling, but I'm hopeful I can get decent works out of it, and put more time into the actual glass and less time into the kiln to make it a more satisfying process.

								<h3>Digital / Physical Transitions</h3>
								<p>
									Pervading everything I create is a transition between digital and physical realms. I go out in nature, and collect digital images. I use my coding and tech skills to process and manipulate those images.
									I write programs to convert digital images into patterns and designs for physical objects, and then make those objects.<br />
									I enjoy all of this because it ties together aspects of who I am - I'm a outdoorsy nature lover who spent their life in tech and thinks digital tools product nifty effects that are a little cheesy on a screen, 
									but kinda cool when brought back into the real world.
