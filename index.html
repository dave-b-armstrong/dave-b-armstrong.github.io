								<h3>Coding experience</h3>
								<p>
									I have coded professionally for over 20 years. I worked in multiple startups, both successful and not, as well as been a key member of internal enterprise IT organizations.
									I worked at various times as an individual team member, tech lead, founder, and independent consultant. The majority of my technical experience has been in web-based applications, including both legacy platforms and modern frameworks.

								<h3>Product experience</h3>
								<p>
									Since 2013, the bulk of my work has been as the technical product owner for the Policy Management system for the K-12 educational market (Document authoring, editing, publishing, and distribution)
								</p>
								<p>
									It began as a small team effort (myself, the CEO, and a SME in policy), acting as a startup-within-a-startup, as part of BoardDocs, the leading K-12 School Board Management product.
									 In our first year, we developed from the initial idea to a working prototype, which we iterated on with 2 state school board assocations. Over the next few years, we integrated the publishing with BoardDocs, expanded to a dozen states, to over 2500 school districts. 
								</p>
								<p>
									After an acquisition of our products, I stepped away for a year starting in mid-2017 to pursue other opportunities, but was asked to return in late 2018, at which point we re-invigorated the product, spending 2019 catching up on the technical backlog, re-engaging with all partners, and are looking forward to evolving it further in 2020.

								<h3>Side Projects</h3>

									I'm down to just one side project currently online:
