								<h3>Coding experience</h3>

									I have coded professionally for over 20 years.

									I worked at various times as an individual team member, tech lead, founder, and independent consultant.
									The majority of my work has been in web-based applications, including modern frameworks (React/node), PaaS (Salesforce), and legacy platforms (Domino, SharePoint).

								<h3>Product experience</h3>

									I spent the bulk of the 2010s building a Policy Management solution for the K-12 market.
