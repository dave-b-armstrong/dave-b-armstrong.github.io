					<strong>What is My Goal with my videos?</strong><br />
					To share my experience and advice about being a working software professional.<br />
					I hope to help people considering this career have an udnerstanding of what it is really like. To help younger software folks think about hgow they approach their work.
					To help all who are interested in software find a healthier, happier way to pursue this career. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>What experience do I have in software?</strong><br />
					I've been working in tech in general since 1990, and in software specifically since 1997.
					I've been through the start of the internet, the original dotcom boom, the growth of software-driven business processes, and the movement to web=-based SaaS taking over the world.
					Throughout all that, I've had a mix of doing my own consulting work, while also working many years in the corporate world, for companies of all sizes. 
					I have broad experience, with a leaning towards content management, document management, and the workflow and business processes that drive content publishing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Would you make a video answering a specific question or on a specific topic?</strong>
					Probably - email me your question, and if it a question or topic that matches what I discuss, I'd be happy to share my thoughts.
