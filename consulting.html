				<p>For the remainder of 2022, I'm available for consulting. The services I offer include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>SMB Process Modernization</strong> - For businesses that are large enough to be feeling some pain in your business processes, I can help decide how to apply the right amount of technical solutions into your processes.
					I'll spend some time learning how your organization works, learning the contraints on your processes and budgets, defining and prioritizing pain points, and coming up with a plan to improve your enterprise.<br />
					Depending on the scope of that plan, I may be able to further help with the actual implementation of your plan, or connect you with other vendors and tech professionals to assist you.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Software platform planning</strong> - Many large enterprises are running older software platforms, which need to be replaced with more modern and maintainable solutions. I can assist with planning an iterative approach to such projects,
						defining a path that will define the long-term vision for your application platforms, and an interative approach to get from where you are today to that vision in reasonably sized interative steps.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Software Team Building</strong> - Many software teams end up with friction and dysfunction amongst team members and leadership. Teams can end up falling apart due to these problems, but they are fixable in most cases.
						I'll come into your office, or work remotely, to have open discussions with all members of the team to understand the unique factors of your team. I'll then identify skills, activites, programs that can improve the team's strength.<br />
						Note: the team and the leaders need to want to improve, and be open to change. This service is ideal for teams who believe in their work, and leaders who want to support the team, but just aren't clicking together.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Domino Support</strong> - One of the quirks that happens when you spend decades in tech is that you end up with great skills in dying legacy platforms. For me, it is the Notes / Domino platform.
						If you still run some old Domino apps, but have lost the team members who know how to really keep them running, let me know - I likely can assist. 
					</li>
					<li><strong>Anything Else? </strong> -  I'm open to other ideas of how I may be able to assist. If you've seen something from me that sparked an interest in what I can do, feel free to email me to discuss what we can do together.</li>
				</ul>

					I'm located in Wisconsin, a half-day or less from Chicago, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis. I'm happy to either work remotely or join you at your location.
