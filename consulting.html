				<p>For the remainder of 2022 (and maybe longer), I'm available for consulting. The services I offer include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Process Modernization</strong> - Analysis and solution design for streamlining business processes and autmating workflow.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Software platform planning</strong> - Modernization of software platforms, shutdown of legacy systems, and iterative plans to get from Point A to Point B without "big-bang" re-writes of core systems.</li>
					<li><strong>Domino support, migration, and shutdowns</strong>
						If you still run Domino apps, I can help with whatever you need, whether that is keeping them going, enhancing them, modernizing, shutting them down, or even just hleping figure out which of those options is best.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Anything Else? </strong> -  I'm open to other ideas of how I may be able to assist.
						 If you've seen something from me that sparked an interest, feel free to email me to discuss what we can do together.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I'm centrally located in Wisconsin, a half-day or less from Chicago, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis and everything in between.
					I primarily work remotely, but can meet up for meetings or a day or two of on-site work.
