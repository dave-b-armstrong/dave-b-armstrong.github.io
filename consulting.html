				<p>For the remainder of 2022 (and maybe longer), I'm available for consulting. The services I offer include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Process Modernization</strong> - For businesses that are feeling pain in their workflow, I can help research technical solutions, finding answers that will fit your budget and other constraints,
						applying the right amount of technical assistance into your day-to-day processes.
					I'll spend some time learning how your organization works, researching and designing solutions, defining and prioritizing pain points, and coming up with a plan to improve your enterprise.<br />
					Depending on the scope of that plan, I may be able to further help with the actual implementation of your plan, or connect you with other vendors and tech professionals to assist you.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Software platform planning</strong> - Many large enterprises run older software platforms, which need to be replaced with more modern and maintainable solutions.
						 I can assist with planning an iterative approach to such projects,
						defining a long-term vision for your application environments, and a path to reach it.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Software Team Building</strong> - Many software teams end up with friction and dysfunction amongst team members and leadership.
						Teams can end up falling apart due to these problems, but they are fixable in most cases.
						I'll have open discussions with all members of the team to understand the unique factors of your team. I'll then identify skills, activites, programs that can improve the team's strength.<br />
						This service is ideal for teams who believe in their work and each other, with leaders who want to support the team, but just aren't clicking together.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Domino Support</strong> - One of the quirks that happens when you spend decades in tech is that you end up with great skills in dying legacy platforms. For me, it is the Notes / Domino platform.
						If you still run some old Domino apps, but have lost the team members who know how to really keep them running... 
						or want help shutting them down, let me know. I likely can assist. 
					</li>
					<li><strong>Anything Else? </strong> -  I'm open to other ideas of how I may be able to assist.
						 If you've seen something from me that sparked an interest, feel free to email me to discuss what we can do together.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I'm centrally located in Wisconsin, a half-day or less from Chicago, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis and everything in between. I'm happy to either work remotely or join you at your location.
