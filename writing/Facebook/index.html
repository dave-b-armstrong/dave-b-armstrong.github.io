They cannot eat hydro-kinetic turbines, right?<br/>• <strong>Andrew K.</strong> -- Just got done reading about how the Columbia River was analyzed and conqured from an energy potential (largest drop of any river in north america) mainly for the Hanford site. Seems like you could build some algorithims for potential kinetic energy stored in a watershed based on elevation, width of the river, etc etc etc. (That is what they did only on paper). Cool stuff mmmmm algorithims ;-) I don&#x27;t like piranhas.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Yep, that is the general idea. NREL already has software that does the modelling for us.. we just need the data. We&#x27;re also trying to target specific installation sizes, as their are varying tiers of regulation in Brazil, and we want to hit a tier that works from a business perspective... Fun stuff.<br/>• <strong>Jeff C.</strong> -- Sounds like a fascinating project.<br/>• <strong>Bill V.</strong> -- Were you able to get hold of the military maps? They are quite detailed.FYI, the piranha leaves a very clean bite. They are OK eating. Not great, just OK.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Nope from the Brazilian military, but I did find old Soviet military maps. We are talking to various people in Brazil as well, so I should be getting even more data soon...<br/>• <strong>Bill V.</strong> -- The maritime maps are also quite good. The big key with any maps of the rivers in that region is that the rivers are quite dynamic. Sand bars can move quickly. One week you go through just fine, next week you run aground on a sand bar in the same spot. So, maps are a base point for looking at general widths of river spots, etc.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- And we should be cool with that.

My son is in track, cross country and football. Then Kaitelyn&#x27;s been in girl scouts, gymnastics and she wants to start swimming lessons. With having a boy and girl and being nine years apart makes it difficult to do things together. The best part is when Kaitleyn is in gymnastics then Chris and I usually lift weights, and run so we can all be in one place doing seperate things. But, yes lots of running..I&#x27;m glad the kids are healthy and active..and I know these years are going to fly by.<br/><br/>My parents actually got to visit with your mom and dad I think a couple of summers ago. And they got to see the boat. Did they sell it? That is really neat to be able to do that and now go on longer trips. I hope that someday down the line I can take trips.

Do you know which database and programming language you will be working with? It is probably easier to point to resources specific to a particular set of technologies instead of something generic.<br/>• <strong>Julie F.</strong> -- hmmm. Well, I&#x27;m kinda starting from the beginning. What programming language do you recommend starting with?<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Sorry for the delayed response. I&#x27;d start with PHP and MySQL - they are free, easy to set up (google XAMPP), and so prevalent that you can find TONS of information online for how-to type stuff. I have a PHP book specifically focusing on getting started with the language, and working with the database. I have to go find it, as I am not quite sure where it is. But you could borrow it...<br/>• <strong>Julie F.</strong> -- That would be awesome.I found some tutorials from the w3 consortium that I&#x27;ve been going through. They&#x27;ve got PHP and SQL as well as html and some basic stuff.BTW, congratulations on the new baby!! It&#x27;s been so long since we&#x27;ve seen each other I totally forgot you were expecting. Boys are crazy, and now you have two. Good luck with that!!

Thanks for asking.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Sounds like things are well for you -- that is great. Colorado is a nice place to visit and&#x2F;or live.

They cannot eat hydro-kinetic turbines, right?<br/>• <strong>Andrew K.</strong> -- Just got done reading about how the Columbia River was analyzed and conqured from an energy potential (largest drop of any river in north america) mainly for the Hanford site. Seems like you could build some algorithims for potential kinetic energy stored in a watershed based on elevation, width of the river, etc etc etc. (That is what they did only on paper). Cool stuff mmmmm algorithims ;-) I don&#x27;t like piranhas.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Yep, that is the general idea. NREL already has software that does the modelling for us.. we just need the data. We&#x27;re also trying to target specific installation sizes, as their are varying tiers of regulation in Brazil, and we want to hit a tier that works from a business perspective... Fun stuff.<br/>• <strong>Jeff C.</strong> -- Sounds like a fascinating project.<br/>• <strong>Bill V.</strong> -- Were you able to get hold of the military maps? They are quite detailed.FYI, the piranha leaves a very clean bite. They are OK eating. Not great, just OK.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Nope from the Brazilian military, but I did find old Soviet military maps. We are talking to various people in Brazil as well, so I should be getting even more data soon...<br/>• <strong>Bill V.</strong> -- The maritime maps are also quite good. The big key with any maps of the rivers in that region is that the rivers are quite dynamic. Sand bars can move quickly. One week you go through just fine, next week you run aground on a sand bar in the same spot. So, maps are a base point for looking at general widths of river spots, etc.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- And we should be cool with that. Our turbines are portable. :)</p></div> </div><div class="timeline-item" data-index="394" data-id="25a6ad5f-8c6f-4c0a-aa94-87bffd8eb541"> <div class="date-title bg-dark font-light"> <div class="date-title-inner"> <div> 11/11/2011 </div> <div> <strong>11/11/2011, 6:53:16 AM</strong> </div> </div> </div> <div class="content bg-light"><p><strong>Dave Armstrong :</strong><br/> Tehanu&#x27;s 6 AM quote: &quot;Dad, is this seriously 80s music?&quot; -- &quot;Yes.&quot; -- &quot;Oh!

I am pretty bummed, and very regretful that I did not find time to see him when I was out east earlier this year. He was one of the kindest kids growing up, and I always enjoyed spending time with him. A 20 mile bike ride to work was therapeutic after hearing this news. Hopefully his family can also get the support they need and find peace through all of this... <br/></p><h3>Comments</h3><p>• <strong>Spouserific</strong> -- aw dave, I&#x27;m sorry.<br/>• <strong>Marc H.</strong> -- Omg Dave....what happened?<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- From what I gather from reading posts on his wall, he had a heart attack a week ago, was in an induced coma since then. He passed away last night. I don&#x27;t know any more details at this point...<br/>• <strong>Marc H.</strong> -- K...I only get a chance to scan fb these days and didn&#x27;t remember seeing anything...thoughts and prayers always<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Yep. Same here. And hey -- you stay healthy! Even if I rarely talk to you, I want us both to grow old and see each other...<br/>• <strong>Marc H.</strong> -- Amen....this news really hit me like a ton of bricks...mortality wise....we started together bro...can&#x27;t be over til we at least see each other again.<br/>• <strong>Christopher G.</strong> -- Sorry to hear, Dave. Be well - you and yours are in our thoughts.<br/>• <strong>Alyssa G.</strong> -- So sorry to hear, Dave.<br/>• <strong>Amy A.</strong> -- Well said Dave...we all went our ways years ago, but I always think of my friends from St. Matt&#x27;s like extended family. We spent do much time together, all our early and middle childhood years. Marc...it made me think of my own mortality too...turning 40 recently...it&#x27;s kind of a change of perspective.<br/>• <strong>Marc H.</strong> -- Yeah Amy....I hit 40 in just a few months....Dave and I are talking about trying to get us all together sometime soon....kind of a St Matt&#x27;s reunion.....would be nice to reconnect face to face<br/>• <strong>Jamie B.</strong> -- This is so said to hear this news. He was a very nice person and way to young to leave this world. I will keep his family in my prayers. I do agree that the friends I made from St Matts do feel like extended family. It would be awesome to get people together...hugs to you Dave...<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- Amy, I am so glad to hear you say that. I always worry that I&#x27;m the odd one out for feeling such a bond with all of you, even thought many of us have not spoken in decades. I&#x27;m glad to know I am not alone.<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- And yes, as Marc said, we&#x27;re kicking around the idea of a get-together. I suppose gathering in Wisconsin would connect the most people. But we also may stage a mini-gathering in South Carolina in the very near future if I can find cheap tickets. :)<br/>• <strong>Marc H.</strong> -- Dave you are totally not alone....I think we all feel the same way....it was an easier time that we all spent together...for so many years<br/>• <strong>Jamie B.</strong> -- Time just seems to slip away and as I get older it seems like it really slips away faster and faster...I am trying really hard to set different priorities as I get older. Life is just way to short...<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- I&#x27;ve been feeling the same way for a while now. I am not sure I can articulate it all in a short comment, but I definitely want to start spending my time in more meaningful ways.<br/>• <strong>Jamie B.</strong> -- I know I made a promise to myself with turning 40 this year that I am changing my ways....and I agree a short comment can not begin to describe how I have felt lately. This post of Todd and a few other things that has happened recently to me makes me realize that my decision of change is a wise choice...<br/>• <strong>Dave Armstrong</strong> -- This whole conversation makes me 100% sure that we need a gathering to get everyone together. Facebook comments don&#x27;t begin to cover this kind of conversation. And I want to see every single person who has posted here, in person.</p></div> </div><div class="timeline-item" data-index="430" data-id="9d619c53-1086-4e93-b017-096fc0d60028"> <div class="date-title bg-dark font-light"> <div class="date-title-inner"> <div> 7/3/2012 </div> <div> <strong>7/3/2012, 6:18:06 AM</strong> </div> </div> </div> <div class="content bg-light"><p><strong>Dave Armstrong :</strong><br/> 40th birthday party on July 28 -- who wants to come?

He was riding his bike to work, a 19 mile ride (he&#x27;s been doing it for almost 2 weeks). He&#x27;s only got about 1 mile on actual road, and about 40 ft of that is narrow road. Yes, guess where this is going. On the narrow part of the road this morning a driver came flying by. Dave moved to the side but must have hit some gravel because the next thing he knew his bike slid out from under him. His left shoulder is broken (pretty badly) and road rash on both elbows and his left knee. His left elbow and knee both have a pretty serious divot. He&#x27;s gotten some medication but is still in a lot of pain. Some prayers would be nice.</p></div> </div><div class="timeline-item" data-index="432" data-id="33e3a25c-e864-470b-a1df-0d6e9400287e"> <div class="date-title bg-dark font-light"> <div class="date-title-inner"> <div> 7/6/2012 </div> <div> <strong>7/6/2012, 3:19:37 PM</strong> </div> </div> </div> <div class="content bg-light"><p><strong>Dave Armstrong :</strong><br/> Today&#x27;s phrase is: Proximal Humerus Fracture.<br/><br/>I was already down one limb, so losing one more for a while is just life, right? <br/></p><h3>Comments</h3><p>• <strong>Craig V.</strong> -- Ouch.<br/>• <strong>Amy A.</strong> -- That&#x27;s &quot;perspective&quot;<br/>• <strong>Jamie B.</strong> -- Bummer...welcome to my world</p></div> </div><div class="timeline-item" data-index="433" data-id="76716c53-acbf-4efd-8b44-c1f884da8205"> <div class="date-title bg-dark font-light"> <div class="date-title-inner"> <div> 7/18/2012 </div> <div> <strong>7/18/2012, 4:36:21 PM</strong> </div> </div> </div> <div class="content bg-light"><p><strong>Dave Armstrong :</strong><br/> Account Deletion in 10 days -- if you are still connected to me on Facebook, then 2 things are most likely true:<br/><br/>1) I care about keeping in touch with you.<br/>2) I don&#x27;t keep in touch with you except for Facebook. <br/><br/>Emails are welcome at dave@hikingdave.com.
